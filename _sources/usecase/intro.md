# Real world example
Clindet has successfully completed the analysis of thousands of WES and WGS samples on the supercomputing cluster at Ruijin Hospital, as well as multi-omics data analyses across multiple disease cohorts. In this section, we present three real-world case studies of omics data analysis to demonstrate Clindetâ€™s powerful capabilities in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data for scientific research:

1. Whole exome sequencing data analysis for mutation and copy number variation detection (Clindet WES)
2. Transcriptome data analysis of multiple myeloma (Clindet RNA)
Whole genome sequencing data analysis of the 
3. COLO829 cell line (Clindet WGS)
4. Whole genome sequencing and mutational signature analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans (custom use)
